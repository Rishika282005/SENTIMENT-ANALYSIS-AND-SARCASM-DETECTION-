SENTIMENT ANALYSIS AND SARCASM  DETECTION 
Sentiment Analysis & Sarcasm Detection

This project integrates sentiment analysis and sarcasm detection to create a more accurate and context-aware Natural Language Processing (NLP) system. Traditional sentiment analyzers often misinterpret sarcasm, since sarcastic text can use positive words to express negative emotions (e.g., "Oh, great. Another Monday morning.").

-> Key Features :

Sarcasm Detection: Uses an LSTM-based deep learning model trained on a labeled dataset of news headlines.

Sentiment Analysis: Uses VADER (NLTK) to classify text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

Hybrid Approach: Combines machine learning (LSTM) and lexicon-based (VADER) methods for better accuracy.

Console Output: Results are displayed with color-coded sentiment and sarcasm status.

-> Tech Stack :

Python 3

TensorFlow / Keras – LSTM model for sarcasm detection

NLTK (VADER) – Rule-based sentiment analysis

Scikit-learn – Train-test split and preprocessing

Colorama – Colored console output

-> Dataset :

News Headline Sarcasm Detection Dataset (Kaggle, JSON format).
Each entry has:
    headline: News headline text
    is_sarcastic: 1 (sarcastic) or 0 (not sarcastic)

-> Example :
     Text: I just love waiting in traffic for hours.
      Sentiment: Negative
      Sarcasm: Sarcastic

-> Future Scope :

Integrate transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) for deeper context understanding.

Expand to multimodal sarcasm detection (emojis, audio, etc.).

Store results in a database (SQLite/MySQL) for analytics.

headline: News headline text

is_sarcastic: 1 (sarcastic) or 0 (not sarcastic)
